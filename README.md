Follow Focus Gears for Lomo Prime Lenses
=============

A follow focus gear designed to fit the barrel of the Foton 37-140mm zoom lens made by LOMO. Gear pitch is the standard 0.8mm.

For those lenses that have the little doodad screwed to the barrel at the forward end of the lens, I've made a second version of the gear that is notched to account for that.

Depending on your lens and the wear on its barrel, the fit may be tight enough to require a bit of sanding before installation.
